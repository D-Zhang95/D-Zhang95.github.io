I am a Theoretical Cosmologist and a PhD Candidate at the Department of Astronomy, University of Science and Technology of China. My main research interests lie in the fields of dark matter, dark energy, and quantum effects in cosmological systems.

Beyond Work
======
When I'm not immersed in research work, you'll find that I have a wide range of interestsâ€”from fascinating science fiction films and philosophical works to singing and dancing. <br>I particularly enjoy brainstorming, even without practical rewards (though occasionally it pays offðŸ˜€, like discovering new research topics), as it provides interesting intellectual challenges and fresh stimulation.
